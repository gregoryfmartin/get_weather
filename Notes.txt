Time Range Start:
datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(forecast_for_city.Daily().Time())

Time Range End:
datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(forecast_for_city.Daily().TimeEnd())

TimeZone Information:
forecast_for_city.Timezone()

forecast_for_city.Daily().Interval() = 86400 (number of seconds in a day)

Python has a tzinfo class
This is evidently very poorly fleshed out as the stdlib doesn't do a good job of inherently supporting time zones. pytz seems like a good answer for this.
Evidently, the datetime library from Python isn't as full-featured as one would initially assume.


Ultimately, what I need to do is determine the delta of time between Time() and TimeEnd() in a 24-hour interval

I've done this, but I need to get values for a datapoint given the day and time (fix the time to 1400 UTC (1200 EST))
There's a pretty simple method for doing this. I'll try to elaborate on it as best as possible here:
    forecast_for_city.Daily().Variables(<int>): openmeteo_sdk.VariableWithValues.VariableWithValues (let's call a sample variable b for here)
    b.ValuesLength() = number of days sampled from the Open Meteo API Call (end_time - start_time)
        therefore...
            b.Values(<int>) where <int> = day of sample set, zero indexed yields the value for the day; 0 = current day
            The name of the weekday can be obtained using the Python calendar module's day_abbr list, and giving it the current day's weekday() value as an index

Putting this differently, the following general call structure would allow for a daily call value:
    forecast_for_city.Daily().Variables(<parameter_id>).Values(<day_id>)

Within the WeatherDayView class, the day_offset variable can change the day that's used to populate the data. If day_offset isn't specified in the constructor, its default value is zero, meaning the current day.
Also, within the WeatherDayView class, the individual portions of the view are populated relative to the current day calculation.

I need to research how to do formatted numerical output.
    This was already handled by f-strings.
