# get_weather

This weather app queries the national weather service for the central ohio area... and no place else.

## TODO:
 - The formating sucks
 - The formating sucks alot
 - allow for other locations?
 - sometimes the service doesn't respond right way giving an error about properties not found... Just try again.
